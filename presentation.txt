Intro
 - Who I am
 - What I work on
 - *Hero of the talk*
 - Donald Knuth wrote, "We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil. Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%."

What does performance mean
 - characterized by the amount of useful work accomplished by a computer system compared to the time and resources used.

Performance: Load
 - How much work is there

Performance: Utilization
 - How much of the resources are in use

Performance: Scalability
 - How can we handle the load

Performance: Throughput
 - How many tasks can be done per unit of time

Performance: Concurerency
 - How many tasks can we do at once

Performance: Capacity
 - How big can our throughput go before things fall apart

Actually...
 - Another testing talk
 - Optimizing up front is often regarded as breaking YouArentGonnaNeedIt (YAGNI).
 - PrematureOptimization is an AntiPattern, since there is only cost and no benefit.

Why does performance matter
 - Slow page respone time results in increased page abandonment

When do you performance test
 - At the end? Freak out!
 - Proactive vs Reactive
 - Premature optimization (see above)

Sample application
 - Show performance baseline

Deploy application
 - Check performance
 - Explain network latency
